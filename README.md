# Minimal-Hand
Minimal-Hand based Pytorch (CVPR2020)
This is a **unofficial** implementation of Minimal-Hand based on PyTorch  


This project provides the core components for hand motion capture:

- estimating joint locations from a monocular RGB image (DetNet)
- estimating joint rotations from locations (IKNet)

## DO
- [x] Inference code like [offical one](https://github.com/CalciferZh/minimal-hand)
- [ ] Training code


# Quick Start
## Download
First, you need download detnet and iknet transfered from tensorflow version. Note that there is a bit of precision error when I transfer tensorflow module to pytorch:
